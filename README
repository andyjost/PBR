What is PBR?
------------

PBR is a microlibrary that extends Boost.Python to provide support for treating
Python objects as models of Boost.Range.  If you are already using
Boost.Python, PBR will give you new tools that may help you write cleaner
interface to Python.

Information about Boost.Python and Boost.Range can be found at www.boost.org.
Information about Python can be found at www.python.org.


Getting Started
---------------
Make sure you have Boost and Python installed.  PBR was tested with Boost
version 1.46 and Python version 2.6.5.  PBR requires linking to the
Boost.Python runtime libraries.  Refer to the Boost documentation for help
building Boost.Python.  Newer versions of Boost, and newer version of Pythong
2.x will probably work just fine.  PBR was not tested against any version of
Python 3000.

After you have the dependencies set up, check the paths in tests/makefile, then
test PBR by issuing "make test" from the tests/ directory.
